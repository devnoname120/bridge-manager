* Added support for the LinkedIn bridge.
* Added `--compile` flag to `bbctl run` for automatically cloning the bridge
  repo and compiling it locally.
  * This is meant for architectures which the CI does not build binaries for,
    `--local-dev` is better for actually modifying the bridge code.
* Marked `darwin/amd64` as unsupported for downloading bridge CI binaries.
* Fixed downloading Signal bridge binaries from CI.
* Fixed CI binary downloading not checking HTTP status code and trying to
  execute HTML error pages instead.

  instead of downloading a CI binary or using pip install.

* Added support for running official Python bridges (`telegram`, `facebook`,
  `instagram`, `googlechat`, `twitter`) and the remaining Go bridge (`slack`).
  * The legacy Signal bridge will not be supported as it requires signald as an
    external component. Once the Go rewrite is ready, a config template will be
    added for it.
* Added `bbctl proxy` command for connecting to the appservice transaction
  websocket and proxying all transactions to a local HTTP server. This enables
  using any 3rd party bridge in websocket mode (removing the need for
  port-forwarding).
* Added [experimental Docker image] for wrapping `bbctl run`.
* Updated minimum Go version to 1.20 when compiling bbctl from source.
